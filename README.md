## 1. Idea and Use Case

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è **ini-able** can be used like any other `*.ini` command line interface out there, it just handles special cases for Unreal Engine 4 `*.ini` files.

**ini-able** is just like any other `*.ini` command line interface (CLI), it just has the ability to modify Unreal Engine 4 `*.ini` files which are a bit of a special case in that realm.

The problem with Unreal Engine 4 `*.ini` files are the following entries:

```ini
[/Script/Engine.Engine]
+ActiveGameNameRedirects=(OldGameName="TP_PuzzleBP",NewGameName="/Script/Test")
```

Standard parsers cannot handle the `+` in front of the actual key. **ini-able** midigates that by parsing Unreal Engine 4 alternations before hand and converting it to a form a standard `*.ini` parser can use. After a successful operation **ini-able** converts the alternations back to Unreal Engine 4 usable form.

Our main use case here at [fivefingergames GmbH](https://fivefingergames.com) is the automated build process of our Unreal Engine 4 projects, with **ini-able** we can switch the needed values within the projects `*.ini` files to perform our desired build.

## 2. Installation

The CLI can easily be installed over [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager). Which can be installed by installing [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/).

Installing machine wide:

```bash
$ npm install -g ini-able

OR

$ yarn global ini-able
```

Installing to local project:

```bash
$ npm install ini-able

OR

$ yarn add ini-able
```

That's it, now you're up and running!

## 3. Usage

The CLI currently only exposes one command, the `set` command.
For a quick glance on how to use it use the commands help page.

```bash
$ ini-able set --help

Usage: ini-able set [options] <value>

Sets a property value.

Options:
  -f, --file [file]        *.ini file to set the property to.
  -o, --out [file]         *.ini file to write to.
  -s, --section [section]  Section where to change the property.
  -k, --key [key]          Key where to change the property.
  -e, --eval               Indecates that the value given is a expression that needs to be evaluated.
  -h, --help               output usage information
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è After `set` exection the `*.ini` contents could potentially be sorted differently.

### Examples

All examples will be based on the [`Test.ini`](https://github.com/mrbandler/ini-able/blob/master/Test.ini), which is a `*.ini` file from an Unreal Engine 4 project.

### Basic Example

In this example we will change a key on the file level section.

Given the following `*.ini` contents:

```ini
bAllowControllers=True
bUseRemoteAsVirtualJoystick=True
```

We execute the following command:

```bash
$ ini-able set False -f ./Test.ini -k bAllowControllers
```

Which results in:

```ini
bAllowControllers=False
bUseRemoteAsVirtualJoystick=True
```

### Section Example

In this example we will change a key on a specific section.

Given the following `*.ini` contents:

```ini
[URL]
GameName=Test

[/Script/IOSRuntimeSettings.IOSRuntimeSettings]
MinimumiOSVersion=IOS_10
bAllowControllers=True
bUseRemoteAsVirtualJoystick=True
bAllowRemoteRotation=True
BundleIdentifier=com.fivefingergames.Test
RemoteServerName=Charon
RSyncUsername=fivefingergames
SigningCertificate=iPhone Distribution: fivefingergames GmbH
MobileProvision=Test.mobileprovision
bShipForBitcode=False
```

We execute the following command:

```bash
$ ini-able set False -f ./Test.ini -s "/Script/IOSRuntimeSettings.IOSRuntimeSettings" -k bAllowControllers
```

Which results in:

```ini
[URL]
GameName=Test

[/Script/IOSRuntimeSettings.IOSRuntimeSettings]
MinimumiOSVersion=IOS_10
bAllowControllers=False
bUseRemoteAsVirtualJoystick=True
bAllowRemoteRotation=True
BundleIdentifier=com.fivefingergames.Test
RemoteServerName=Charon
RSyncUsername=fivefingergames
SigningCertificate=iPhone Distribution: fivefingergames GmbH
MobileProvision=Test.mobileprovision
bShipForBitcode=False
```
